# Sovereign

An experiment in software that has sovereignty over itself.

## Introduction

This is an exploration into what it would be like to have a running piece of software that self-verified any changes
to itself before applying them.

In this way, it has **sovereignty** over itself.

This repository gives you such a server that simply admits _any_ patch as a starting point.

To try it yourself, see the [developer docs](DEVELOPER.md).

The remainder of this README plays out different thought experiments by actually performing them against a real
sovereign server.

For additional thoughts, see this repository's [discussions](https://github.com/jdhenke/sovereign/discussions).
